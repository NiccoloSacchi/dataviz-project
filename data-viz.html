					What is our platform about?
					</h2>
                    <p>
					Buying from huge e-commerce websites such as Amazon has many advantages, but paradoxically, users are often confused by the vast variety of products that are offered. 
					Users may have a rough idea about the characteristics of the product they want to buy, but they often undergo the same process of comparing similar items. 
					We aim to remove this redundancy and aid them in their purchases, suggesting the best or most popular products that correspond to their search. 
					For instance, comparing smartphones or laptops may be difficult due to the wide price range and the required technical knowledge. 
					With our platform, users can easily search in a graphical way the most popular products that match their needs.
                    </p>
					<h2 class="post-subtitle">
					Why is our solution effective?
					</h2>
					<p> 
					When you look at a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Acer-E5-575-33BM-15-6-Inch-Notebook-Generation/dp/B01K1IO3QW/ref=sr_1_3?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1512207600&sr=1-3&keywords=laptop">product on Amazon</a>, 
					you may notice a small window at the bottom of the page that indicates what <i> other </i> products users usually buy instead.
					We call it a <i> competition </i> relation. What do we do is just to build a network of these relations among all products for each category.
					If a product is associated with many of these relations, it means that users have preferred it many times over the others.
					This new way of defining popular products allows us to group them according to human-made criteria: the brand, the price or some peculiar
					characteristics. But <i> how </i> is decided by humans, not algorithms. Just like you.
					<h2 class="post-subtitle">
					Who should use our platform?
					</h2>
					<p>
					With our platform we want to aid both customers and vendors. 
					Customers may take advantage of previous people's choices to decide what product is worth buying, or to get an idea about alternative items. 
					Vendors may explore the visualization to search competitors and see the characteristics of the most popular items in their category. 
                    </p>

						<h3 class="post-subtitle">
							Choose a category
                        </h3>
                        <div class="post-entry">
							<img src="img/home/category_graph.png" alt="" />
							Categories are represented as a hierarchy, and you can click on the dots to navigate through it. 
							You can also directly type on the search bar the category that you are looking for.
							On the left, the timeline shows your current category, and it allows you to undo your steps.
							Green dots indicate that you have reached the end of the hierarchy, and by clicking on them, you can jump into the
							product network of that category.
                        </div>
                        <!--<div id="categories_graph"></div>-->

                            Explore the network
                        </h3>
                        <div class="post-entry">
							<img src="img/home/products_graph.png" alt="" />
							Now you are inside a category, where you can see a large network of coloured dots.
							They represent products, and they are connected together according to customers' shopping trends.
							If an arrow points from a dot to another, it means that users usually buy the second after viewing the first.
							You can also notice some stars, which are pointed by many arrows. Those are products that have been chosen
							several times over the others by customers. In simpler words, they are the most popular products in category.
							Finally, you may wonder what the colours represent. They show the price of the product. 
							Cheaper products are shown as green, while more expensive products are shown as red. With all the shades in between, of course.

							Some products are surrounded by a coloured halo. We call them <i> competing products</i>.
							If you look closely, they are groups in which each product points to and is pointed by the others.
							These items have very similar characteristics, and not necessarily one is better than the others. 
							The choice is up to you!
